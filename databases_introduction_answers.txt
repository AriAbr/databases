2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be
used.

A database would be used when an application needs to save data created for
later use, be able to handle multiple instances running simultaneously. A text
can be useful because it can be more easily read and manually edited by a human.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is declarative, meaning you describe the result that you want to achieve, as
opposed to many other languages which are procedural, meaning that you have to
describe step-by-step exactly how you want a task to be performed.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together
at a high level.

The data in organized in a table and sits in the database separately from the
rest of the application. The application communicates with the database while it
is running and is able to add, change and retrieve the data in the database.
When the application closes, whatever changes it made to the data are saved in
the database instead of being lost.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A value is an individual piece of data. A column is a collection of values of the
same type, both in the technical sense and in the sense that they have a similar
kind of meaning. A row binds a set of values across several columns together.
A table binds a set of rows together.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

String, number, boolean.
